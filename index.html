            <p>By <a href="https://github.com/adiel3">Adiel Kaplan</a></p>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>Back in May, I found myself learning far more than I ever expected to about about paint colors, as my friend 
            Sara agonized over what color to repaint her bedroom, updating me with every new option along the way. 
            After weeks of consideration and many paint samples, she finally selected <span style='color:#BBA8A3'><b>Lost Locket</b></span>, 
            a pleasant, grayish mauve from Benjamin Moore.</p>
        <p>But there was something about the color that struck both of us — unlike the dozen others she had considered, the description for 
            <span style='color:#BBA8A3'><b>Lost Locket</b></span> on the company's website was strangely whimsical:</p>
        <p class="indented"><span style='color:#BBA8A3'><i>"There, between the attic floorboards, a small, pink sweetheart necklace called out to be found."</i></span></p>
        <p>All the other paints she had shown me had unremarkable descriptions — short sentences about the shade, undertones or origin of the color. 
            But this, this was poetry.</p>
        <p>Like a good poem, the words stuck with me, perhaps for their incongruity or the questions they prompted. 
            The "necklace calling out to be found" would pop into my head at random moments over the next few weeks, and I soon 
            began to wonder if there were other poems hidden in the Benjamin Moore paint library?</p>
        <p>By July, I realized that I needed to know.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Moore, one of the top paint manufacturers in the United States, lists <b>3,589 paint colors</b> across <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color-families">nine color families</a> 
            on its website. Details about each paint, including the color description, live on individual pages — too many for a person seeking poetry to sift through one by one.</p>
            <p>But not too many for an enterprising data journalist to turn into an analyzable dataset.</p>
        <p>So that is what I did. Using a combination of browser-automated web scraping and undocumented API queries to the <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us">benjaminmoore.com</a> paint 
            search tool, I downloaded a database of <b>3,657 paint colors,</b> along with their descriptions, hex codes and other basic details. 
            (I found 68 additonal paint colors through the undocumented API that were not in the list of paint names scraped from the color family webpages.)</p>
        <p>To categorize the descriptions, I turned to ChatGPT, asking the large language model to classify them several different ways.</p>
        <p>First I had it tell me which of the descriptions were for colors. Then which ones were poetry. It labeled <b>97.2%</b> as color 
            descriptions and <b>6.6%</b> as poetry. There were some it determined were both, and a few it labeled as neither.</p>

        <iframe title="Five percent of Benjamin Moore paint descriptions are poems and color descriptions, per ChatGPT" aria-label="Stacked Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-jWD4U" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jWD4U/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="462" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p>I looked through the 59 descriptions that the model considered neither poems nor color descriptions and noticed a pattern — many of them read like lines 
            from a strange story. A few of the descriptions also seemed to be about colors from a specific hisorical era. 
            So I went back to ChatGPT, this time giving the artificial intelligence more freedom. Instead of yes/no questions, I asked it to classify the descriptions 
            as one of four types: color description, poetry, story, or historically specific.</p>
        
        <p>Then I looked to see if there were any trends across the different color families. There was some variation, but because the vast 
            majority for each color family were labeled descriptions, the differences were small.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        <iframe title="Gray and neutral colors had the highest percent of non-standard color descriptions" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-PX5Vb" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PX5Vb/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="484" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>
        
        <br><br>   
        
        <p>There were dozens of descriptions that the model determined were lines from a story. More than double the number it labeled as poetry, in fact.
            It was not successful at labeling the historical colors, however, finding only one, <b><span style='color:#6E743A'>Timson green:</span></b></p>
        <p class="indented"><span style='color:#6E743A'><i>"Based on early 19th century paint evidence found on the Timson House located just outside the historic area."</i></span></p>            
        <p>A quick manual check found at least a dozen descriptions that referenced paints specific to a decade, century or historic place. 
            It is likely that the historical part of this classification could be made to work using training data, since there were clear examples in the dataset. 
            Unfortunately, that was beyond the scope of this project.</p>
        
        <p>The descriptions the model classified in the story category had quite a range though, from bubble tea snacks to horseback rides and hardy shrubs:</p>
        <ul><i>
            <li><span style='color:#C86361'>"Savoring the fruity tea and the pink tapioca beads, she welcomed this cool delight against the blazing August heat."</span></li>
            <li><span style='color:#6B4E3E'>"Newly polished, my favorite boots were ready for a fall ride with the new mare."</span></li>
            <li><span style='color:#C2C8B8'>"Wind whips through the New Mexican desert, displacing sand and rock, yet the hardy shrubs stand their ground."</span></li>
        </i></ul>

        <p>To check the model's work, I read through each description that it had put in a category other than "color description" and manually 
            noted whether I considered them as lines from a story. I generally agreed with the model, but added a number of the descriptions 
            it had classified as poetry to the story category, for a total of <b>95 story descriptions.</b></p>
            
        <p>The story lines were fascinating, and I was curious what they would look like together. So I asked the model one last thing — 
            to write a story using only those 95 descriptions. That story is below, with each in the color it is describing (some descriptions have multiple sentences):</p>

        <div class="story"><b><i>
            <p><span style='color:#949476'>In his crisp dress uniform, the new cadet strolled the hallowed hallways, a surge of pride filling his chest. </span>

                <span style='color:#BB9D61'>The brilliant silk-damasked walls seemed to swirl with the orchestra's waltz. "Care to join in the dance?" he asked. </span>
                <span style='color:#D1B9A9'>As they left the dance, he placed the soft pashmina around her shoulders to ward off the evening chill.</span></p>
